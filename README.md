My restaurant consultant husband asked me to quickly develop an application that calculates the total recipe cost without requiring the entry of ingredient quantities. The purpose is to provide a swift and efficient tool for showcasing costs to his clients.

I plan to make enhancements in the near future, enabling users to input the quantity of ingredients (in ounces) for a more accurate calculation of the true recipe cost.
